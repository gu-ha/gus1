<h2>PET</h2>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">pet or <strong>companion animal</a>,</strong> is an <u>animal</u> kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal.
Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances, intelligence and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.<p>Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats; the technical term for a cat lover is an ailurophile and a dog lover a cynophile.
